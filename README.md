# tic-tac-toe
<b>This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, where two players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with either 'X' or 'O'. The first player to align three of their marks (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If the grid is full and no player has achieved this, the game ends in a draw.</b>
